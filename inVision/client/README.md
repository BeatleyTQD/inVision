# inVision
Everyone has a dream they know they should spend more time pursuing but the infectious call of YouTube’s algorithm is often too strong to ignore. Or they’ve only got 15 free minutes and you have to spend 10 of those figuring out what you could do with such a short period of time. 

inVision is a mobile app where users can create “Dreams” that have associated “Why”s and “How”s. The “Why”s to remind them why they wanted to pursue the dream in the first place and the “How”s to give them direction when they want to work on said dream but don’t know what to do by pulling from their list of “How”s and randomly displaying one based on their available time.
